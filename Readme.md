Unchained is a distributed computing platform that allows you to run your applications on a global network of computers. It is designed to be fast, secure, and scalable.

## What are the use cases of Unchained?

Unchained is a distributed computation engine:

1. You can use it independently to run your computation-intensive tasks on a powerful grid. Once in production, you can host your APIs on the Unchained network.
2. You can use Unchained with other decentralized networks; for example, you can index blockchain events, create decentralized Oracles, or create cross-chain bridges.

Cryptographic signatures and a proof-of-stake consensus secure all computations on Unchained.
