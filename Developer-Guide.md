# Developer Guide

This article is a guide for developers who want to contribute to the Unchained project. The project is written in Go and we are open to all new suggestions and ideas, so keeping the codes clean and efficient is really important.

## Conventions

We follow the practices which is recommended by golang documents as [Effective Golang](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) actually with some modifications. But its better to read it and follow the rules. Most of the important ones are covered in our linters, so if you need to check your codes, you can use the following command:

```bash
golangci-lint run --fix
```

It will fix correctable issues and show the rest of them.

## Development Environment

The project is not depends on a specific IDE or special tools, but some tools are necessary to be installed on your machine to run the project:

- Go: The project is written in Go, so you need to install Go on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- Docker: The project uses docker to run the services on production mode, if you need to test and run project on docker, so you need to install docker on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Golang linter: The project uses golangci-lint to lint the codes and check the best practices. You can install it from [here](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/).
- Other: for other tools and contribution ways please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) doc.

## Project Structure

The Project follows the Clean Architecture pattern. The project is divided into the following layers:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    X[Broker] <--> |Websocket|Y[Worker Handler]
    X[Broker] <--> |Websocket|Z[Consumer Handler]
    Y[Worker Handler] <--> C(Attestation Service)
    Z[Consumer Handler] <--> C(Attestation Service)
    E[Schduler] -->|every X min| C(Attestation Service)
    C(Attestation Service) <--> U(Repository)
    C(Attestation Service) <--> V(Ethereum)
    C(Attestation Service) <--> M(Machine Identity)

```

- Services: This layer contains the business logic of the application.
- Repository: This layer contains the data access logic of the application which can be implemented for postgres, mongodb, etc.
- Handler: This layer contains the adapters for websocket packet processing.

and the layout is inspired by this [repository](https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template), also with some modifications.

## Concepts

### Federated Network

The Unchained network is a federated network that consists of three types of nodes: Broker, Worker, and Consumer. Anyone can run a new node and help the network to process the load and requests.

#### Broker

The broker nodes are responsible for managing the network and routing the data to the correct worker and consumer nodes. The clients of brokers consist of following:

- Consumers: They listen to the data from the brokers and save or use them.
- Workers: They process the data and send them the brokers.
- Clients: They request to run a rpc function.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    U([ٌClient]) <--> |Websocket| W[Server]
    X([ٌWorker]) <--> |Websocket| W[Server]
    V([Consumer]) <--> |Websocket| W[Server]
    W[Server] --> |Sign & Verify| T[Machine Identity]

```

#### Worker

The workers are the nodes that process the data and send them to the broker. The workers can be a service that listens to the data from the blockchain, or a service that listens to the data from the broker. These services hold different business logics and will provide different services to the network.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    V[Broker] <--> |Websocket| W[Services]
    W[Services] --> |Sign & Verify| T[Machine Identity]

```

#### Consumer

The consumers are the nodes that listen to the data from the broker and save or use them. These data be saved in a database, or be served to the users by an API.

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    V[Broker's Update] --> |Websocket| W[Services]
    W[Services] --> |Sign & Verify| T[Machine Identity]
    W[Services] --> |Save Data| Z[Database]
```

### RPC infrastructure

The unchained network makes ability to run a function on a worker node and get the result. The broker node is responsible for routing the request to the correct worker node and get the result back to the client.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Worker->>+Broker: I can run these functions
    Client->>+Broker: Run X func with these args
    Broker->>+Worker: Run X func with these args
    Worker->>+Broker: Ok! here is the results.
    Broker->>+Client: Here is your result.
```

#### RPC Runtime

When you start a worker node, you can register the functions that you can run on the worker node. The broker node will get the list of functions and will route the request to the correct worker node. each function has a unique id and the runtime configuration of how it works. The runtimes can be:

- **Unix Socket**: This method will refer the request to a unix socket which is provided on worker startup with this struct:

```go
type RPCRequest struct {
	// The ID of the request
	ID uuid.UUID `json:"id"`
	// The signature of the request
	Signature [48]byte `json:"signature"`
	// The method to be called
	Method string `json:"method"`
	// params to pass to the function
	Params []byte `json:"params"`
}
```

and at the end worker expect a result like this:

```go
type RPCResponse struct {
	// The ID of the request
	ID uuid.UUID `json:"id"`
	// The error of the function
	Error uint64 `json:"error"`
	// The response of the function
	Response []byte `json:"response"`
}
```

- **Docker**: This method will refer the request to a docker container.

### Identity and Security

In a network like Unchained we send and receive many data from other parties and we need to identify and validate the data sender. in other hand, we communicate with different blockchains and every node needs to keep the keys and addresses of the blockchain.

These keys are hold on a global machine identity and will used once the node wants to sign a message or verify a message.

#### BLS

A BLS digital signature, also known as Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS), is a cryptographic signature scheme which allows a user to verify that a signer is authentic. The scheme uses a bilinear pairing for verification, and signatures are elements of an elliptic curve group.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    worker->>+Broker: Say Hello!
    Consumer->>+Broker: Say Hello!
    Broker->>+worker: Sign this challenge! Ill remember you...
    Broker->>+Consumer: Sign this challenge! Ill remember you...
    Consumer->>+Broker: Here you go! Signed...
    worker->>+Broker: Here you go! Signed...
    Broker->>+worker: Now you can send other messages
    Broker->>+Consumer: Now you can send other messages
    Consumer->>+Broker: I wanna listen to XXX topic
    Broker-->>+Consumer: All events on subscribed topic
```

#### Ethereum

A Key pair of private and public keys which represent the identity of the node in the Ethereum network. and address of smart contract which is used to sync the nodes together.
